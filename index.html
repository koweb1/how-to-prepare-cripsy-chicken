        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
        <li> Chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, or breasts) </li>
        <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 tsp salt </li>
        <li> tsp black pepper </li>
        <li> 1 tsp paprika (optional, for color and flavor) </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp garlic powder </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp onion powder </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional for a bit of spice)</li>
        <li> 2 eggs </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup buttermilk (or regular milk if you don’t have buttermilk) </li>
        <li> Vegetable oil for frying </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> instructions </h2>
        <ul>
        <li> prepare the Chicken </li>
        <li> Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels. This helps the coating stick better. </li>
        <li> Marinate In a bowl, mix the buttermilk (or milk) with one of the eggs and a pinch of salt.
        Submerge the chicken pieces in the buttermilk mixture, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to overnight for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Coating  In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). This is your seasoned flour for dredging the chicken.</li>
        <li>Coat the Chicken In another shallow bowl, beat the second egg.</li>
        Remove the chicken from the marinade, dip each piece into the beaten egg, then dredge it in the seasoned flour mixture. Make sure the chicken is fully coated, pressing lightly to make sure the coating sticks well.<br/>
        <li>Fry the Chicken</li> 
        <p> Heat about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a large skillet or deep fryer to 350°F (175°C). <br/>
        Carefully lower the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, one at a time. Don't overcrowd the pan—fry in batches if needed.
        Fry the chicken for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). The chicken should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
        Drain and Serve: </p> 
        <li> Remove the chicken from the oil and drain it on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb any excess oil.
        <p> Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.<br>
        Enjoy your crispy fried chicken! You can serve it with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or cornbread.</p>
